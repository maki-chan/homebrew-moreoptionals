# Moreoptionals

Homebrew formulae with more enabled features than the core ones. Unfortunately needed after homebew-core removed all options from formulae.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install maki-chan/moreoptionals/<formula>`

Or `brew tap maki-chan/moreoptionals` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maki-chan/homebrew-moreoptionals/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## How do I use these formulae instead of the matching core ones (i.e. replacing core formulae)?
After you tapped this repository according to the instructions above, simpy do `brew tap-pin maki-chan/moreoptionals`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
